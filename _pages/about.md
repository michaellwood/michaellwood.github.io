I am an assistant professor of Sociology at [Brigham Young University (BYU)](http://sociology.byu.edu). I completedÂ my PhD in Sociology at the University of Notre Dame.

I am a cultural sociologist with special interests in cognition, religion, and computational methods. I study the cultural and social dynamics that affect reasoning and behavior (including parenting decisions and church attendance), and develop computational tools for measuring culture. I am a contributor at [Culture, Cognition, and Action](http://culturecog.blog).
