I am an assistant professor of Sociology at [Brigham Young University (BYU)](http://sociology.byu.edu). I completedÂ my PhD in Sociology at the University of Notre Dame.

I am a cultural sociologist with special interests in cognition, religion, and computational methods. I study the cultural and social dynamics that affect reasoning and behavior (including parenting decisions and church attendance), and develop computational tools for measuring culture. I am a contributor at [Culture, Cognition, and Action](http://culturecog.blog).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
